Rikki Held grew up on a 7,000-acre ranch in Broadus, Montana, where she learned the family business of ranching, hunted deer and elk, and played in the river that cut through the land. But drought, animal disease, wildfires, and environmental emergencies caused largely by climate change have followed Held throughout her life, impeding her family’s ability to run their business and jeopardizing her health and well-being.

So she decided to do something about it. In 2020, Held joined 15 other young people suing the State of Montana for violating the state’s constitution. The plaintiffs say lawmakers willfully allowed fossil fuel corporations to operate and thus pose a threat to their state constitutional right to a healthful environment. Amid a growing movement of youth climate activism in the streets, where young people who can’t vote can be heard, a youth climate case will go to trial in 2023 for the first time ever. “Our constitutional rights, like a clean and healthful environment … really match Montana values,” Held tells Teen Vogue. As ranchers, she says, “we are connected to the environment.”

The youth plaintiffs in the case, Held, v. State of Montana, are represented by the Oregon-based nonprofit law firm Our Children’s Trust, an organization that has brought multiple youth climate suits, most notably Juliana v. United States, a 2015 case in which 21 young people sued the federal government for knowingly and extensively contributing to climate change and with these actions violating their constitutional rights.

But this is the first time that a case of this nature has been allowed to enter the trial phase, which will likely begin in early summer 2023. Advocates say the trial is a landmark opportunity to hold a governing body accountable for its role in perpetuating climate change and to establish a plan for remedy and relief. If successful, it also lays the groundwork for the courts to rule in favor of young people in future climate lawsuits.

“As young people, we don't have … the right to vote. We can't solve it through the other branches of government. We need to rely on the courts to protect our rights,” Held says. “This case could have impacts beyond Montana.”

How Held v. State of Montana could work.
While youth activism has a storied history in the U.S., Michael Burger, executive director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School, says the first youth climate lawsuit was filed in 2011, just over a decade ago. Plaintiffs represented in Alec L. v. Jackson sued the head of the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for failing to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and, in doing so, violating what’s known as the public trust doctrine. ​​

The public trust doctrine holds that it’s the government’s responsibility to preserve some ecosystems, like waterways, that are commonly viewed as resources, so that everyone can enjoy them. But in 2012, a judge denied the claims, writing, “Ultimately, this case is about the fundamental nature of our government and our constitutional system, just as much — if not more so — than it is about emissions, the atmosphere, or the climate.” In other words, the judge ruled that it wasn’t the responsibility of the judicial branch to remedy human-caused climate change.

Other youth climate suits have cited the public trust doctrine in legal claims, but learning from the dismissal of Alec, subsequent lawsuits pointed to specific language in U.S. and state constitutions as evidence that the government was not upholding its constitutional duties. Juliana v. United States demonstrates the shift in legal strategy.

Juliana sued the federal government for violating the public trust doctrine as well as for impeding the young people’s substantive due process rights. But government agencies, namely the Department of Justice, have slow-rolled the case, and it remains to be seen if Juliana’s plaintiffs will get their day in court. With each passing year, the climate destabilization that originally motivated the 21 young people to go to court compounds.

“I get scared all the time,” Sahara Valentine, a plaintiff in Juliana, tells Teen Vogue. “I'm scared that the world that I'm living in right now is going to be so different from the world that I'm going to be living in years from now. I'm worried that I am going to have to decide whether or not I want to have kids based on if it's safe for them.”

Usually, youth climate lawsuits are thrown out. Burger explains that judges typically look to their peers to see how they should rule on a case in situations where their opinions could have a precedent-setting effect. This is part of what makes the Held trial significant in that a judge wants to hear the evidence, signaling that the courts may be the site for climate remediation after all.

But Burger isn’t overly excited, as there are still a lot of unknowns. “Specific questions about causation and responsibility have not been tried in a court of law,” Burger says. While we can link some environmental impacts to specific federal agencies, like the Bureau of Land Management’s decision to lease federal land for fracking, Burger says that “the science of climate change and … the relationship between climate change and individual health impacts … has not gone to trial in the United States before.”

Drawbacks of using the courts to target fossil fuel companies.
With money to be made from fossil fuels, extractive industries helped to politicize climate science and the very idea of the environment that surrounds us, challenging the basic concept of whether Americans bear an inalienable right to clean air, water, and food. And by putting science into the ring of politics, the two major parties have, for the last 40 years, taken opposing stances on what to do about climate change. Congress has largely failed to take substantive climate action, in part due to senators like West Virginia’s Joe Manchin, who is invested in the coal industry and has blocked a number of climate proposals from passing in the Senate, and in part due to differing ideas about whether the approach should be piecemeal or systemic.

Obscure procedural rules and partisan gerrymandering have made Congress particularly poorly suited to address a problem as complex and threatening to the human race. In both Washington, DC and in statehouses across the country, decades of successful anti-climate campaigns waged by extractive corporations influenced elected officials to distrust science and spread the message to the public that climate change was neither a dire nor a deadly issue.

Naomi Oreskes, professor of the history of science at Harvard University and coauthor of the book Merchants of Doubt, says that scientists started talking about the potential impacts of climate change in the 1960s and 1970s. At that point, their research outlined what could happen if greenhouse gas-emitting industries were allowed to continue business as usual: Increased carbon dioxide emissions would increase global temperatures. In the late 1980s, a senior NASA scientist testified to Congress that climate change was already underway — and no longer just a far-off possibility.

Corporations, public relations firms, conservative think tanks, and front groups immediately rebutted the science with bogus claims of their own beginning with the circulation of a climate change denial report in 1989, Oreskes says. “As soon as climate change goes from being a prediction about the future to being a fact about the present, that's when we see the denial network kick in,” Oreskes says. In those earlier days, she explains, “we didn't have the sense of outrage and urgency that, in my view, we should have had, in large part because of these disinformation campaigns.”

Many Republican-controlled states like Montana are economically intertwined with extractive industries and politically aligned with other right-leaning states that oppose progressive leadership that would fight for the passage of climate legislation. Eighteen Republican attorneys general, who collectively received millions of dollars in lobbying funds from fossil fuel corporations, filed a motion in 2021 to intervene in the Juliana case, saying that the judicial system isn’t the place to mitigate climate change. Despite their claims that such a lawsuit could hurt their state economies, there’s ample evidence that climate change is already costing U.S. taxpayers, not to mention that for some low-income states like Mississippi, the poverty created by plantation economies that undermined wealth-building for Black families will be further exacerbated by flooding, drought, and other climate effects.

“Fundamentally, what we need now is political action,” Oreskes says. And yet, she says, “We have people in Congress who do not represent us … poll after poll after poll shows the American people want action on climate change.”

What's next for climate change lawsuits.
It’s not just the young people behind Held who are hopeful that years of legal activism may finally get results. It’s the 21 young people of Juliana v. United States who may see a trial in the next year or two if a judge allows. It’s seven youth in Utah represented in Natalie R v. State of Utah, who recently announced that they were suing their state, claiming it’s long known about the dangers of climate change and still supports industries that profit from emissions. The case was also filed by Our Children’s Trust and is awaiting a response to their initial March 2022 legal filing.

All these cases are attempting to answer similar and urgent questions: Who’s accountable for making people sick? If an industry is recognized as harmful, are they allowed to make money from that harm? And when a person in the U.S., who is protected by the legal affirmations of the Constitution, says the harm is violating their right to life, what is the government’s responsibility?

Climate change is displacing and killing people around the world and the U.S. bears a disproportionate responsibility for these harmful emissions. This is what needs to be remembered, Burger says: “These issues are not just sort of hyper-technical questions of global climate policy. They're actually about people's lives.”
