Still wondering what to do after high school? While roughly 45% of high school graduates transitioned straight from the halls of high school to a college campus in 2022, that's just one of many paths you can take. If you're not ready to grab your shower caddy and head for the dorms, there are plenty of things you can do. There's no law that says you have to go to college three months after you graduate from high school.

Considering a nontraditional post-graduation path can give you a better sense of purpose for whatever you decide you want to do in life. If you're not convinced though, or have no idea what you'd do with the time away from school, consider some of these post-graduation paths.

Discover nine things to do after high school that have nothing to do with college.

1. Travel abroad
Graduation means freedom from classwork, exams, teachers, and extracurricular activities. It can be the opportune time in your life to see the world you have spent so much time learning about in textbooks and put those foreign languages to use. Take it from Bailey Theado, who deferred her enrollment at university for a well-organized trip and volunteer work.

Theado's adventure took her across Nepal, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Laos, and Thailand, and then Denmark and France. This included a photojournalism internship, a project on the Akha hill tribe, and volunteering in Tibet.

She wanted to have a year to find out exactly what she was interested in and what she liked to make sure her four years at college would be worth the cost of tuition. “I think the year after high school is the sweet spot to find out what you're really passionate about," Theado said.

Be aware that a decision like this, if done right, isn’t spontaneous. Theado saved $7,000 from two years of working as an archivist, digitizing family albums, and as a part-time nanny. It took careful planning, googling, and scheduling before takeoff.

2. Do charity work
While you may have put in some hours after school to volunteer, taking time after high school to really dedicate yourself to a cause is something you should carefully consider. Research organizations that are doing important work in the areas you care most about. Spending a significant amount of time fighting for that cause, and being surrounded by professionals in the field can help give you more direction as you think about your future. Interested in helping at-risk youth? Hoping to help more women get access to free health care? Want to see what you can do to protect the environment at a local level? With the elections coming up, this may be the time for you to try on your political hat and see if that is an avenue worth exploring. Get involved in your community and see where it takes you.

3. Save money
College is expensive. According to Forbes, more than half of college attendees leave with student loan debt. Even public school tuition – which tends to be less than that for private schools – has risen from $4,160 to $10,740 over the past three decades. Add the day-to-day living costs to tuition and students find themselves paying off debt for years. And it's not uncommon for this debt to impact the mental health of students.

Instead of heading straight to school, consider a year of work to save up for this pricey academic adventure. We’re not saying to set your eyes on your dream job, but starting small will pay off when you do set out for school.

Hit up your favorite local shops and retail stores to see if they're hiring or ask around to see if people in your neighborhood need a long-term babysitter or tutor. These jobs can lead to important personal connections in the future or a more involved, paid project. You can also search for paid internships for students who have deferred college for a year. While it may not be glamorous, this experience could be an important lesson in managing your finances. When you're done, you’ll be better prepared for college, not only because you'll hopefully have money in your pocket, but because you'll be armed with the basic principles of financial responsibility.

4. Concentrate on your passion
Are you a talented painter, but school always had you reaching for pens instead of paintbrushes? Always had an eye for photography but never the opportunity to use it? Instead of rushing to college, which will have you equally as bound to your textbooks, consider allowing time for a skill you really want to cultivate.

The summer before starting her BFA program at Elon University in North Carolina, Blaine Morris was contacted about an internship on the writing team of the US version of the popular UK teen drama, Skins. After spending time in their writers’ room, she was asked to become a permanent teen consultant. The creator eventually pulled Morris aside to tell her the part she had given so much feedback about, lesbian cheerleader Tea, was written for her. “I was utterly dumbfounded. This was not part of the life plan. This opportunity created an incredibly tough decision for me: Start school at a top-rated BFA program and follow my lifelong dream of being on Broadway or play a character that I loved and helped create on a TV show with no clear outcome.”

Morris had spent her entire high school career focused on following the traditional path toward college, but says, "I knew that if I left the opportunity behind, it would be one of my biggest regrets.” Two weeks after moving into Elon, she packed her bags and flew to Toronto to film Skins. Morris gave up going straight to college for an experience and opportunity she couldn’t refuse, and one she had started to create before graduating. Plus, when her time on Skins wrapped, she was able to go to college and is now pursuing producing, writing, and directing classes at Columbia University in New York.

5. Go after a fellowship
If you are confident you have a great idea, see if there are other people out there who agree. While it's smart to keep your sights set on college, seek out fellowships that may offer an alternative route. These are competitive, but that’s how you know if someone is willing to invest in you and your idea. The time after graduation may be the moment to take off with your vision — and with the support of a fellowship, you will have the financial backup and often the mentorship necessary to succeed.

“The fellowship gave me the financial and social capital to develop myself and my ideas in a setting like Silicon Valley and New York City, where optimists are celebrated,” says John Marbach, a 2011 Thiel Fellowship recipient. “I feel that taking time to vigorously pursue my interests outside of school was one of the best decisions I ever made. I learned a lot about the dedication and exceptional skill required to build amazing software products, but I learned even more about myself, my relationships, and the way I want to impact the world.”

6. Become an online entrepreneur
Getting a fellowship isn't the only path to entrepreneurial success. You can bootstrap your own business and there are limitless opportunities online. Have a knack for fashion and marketing? Consider starting a store with Shopify or create an eBay empire.

Are you artistic or crafty? You can make your wares and sell them on Etsy. Are you an amazing writer with a lot of opinions? You could start a blog and monetize it with ads. Or you could start a YouTube channel to showcase a passion you have. Who says you can't be the next big YouTube star?

7. Intern with Projects Abroad
Projects Abroad is an offshoot of the Peace Corps. The Peace Corps isn't an option for high school graduates given that the programs require a bachelor's degree. With Projects Abroad, however, anyone 16 and over can join.

Projects Abroad offers short-term internships around the world. You'll be able to get hands-on experience in fields including business, international development, journalism, law, human rights, medicine, health care, microfinance, social work, veterinary medicine, and animal care. By participating in an internship like this, you might learn more about the college and career path you eventually want to take.

8. Focus on your mental health
If you are fortunate enough to be able to take some downtime, you should absolutely do so before the demands of adult life fully kick in. A 2021 report from the CDC found that mental health concerns among adolescents were worsening even before the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the report, 29% of high school respondents experienced poor mental health and 22% said they had suicidal ideations in the month prior to participating in the survey. If you were one of the students who struggled with your mental health in high school, now is a great time to prioritize your well-being and enact some helpful practices for the long term.

Explore your options for therapy, join a support group, and journal. Prioritizing your mental health can also look like finally getting enough sleep now that you're no longer stressing over homework and tests, doing some physical activity outdoors, taking up a hobby, or spending much-needed time with friends and loved ones.

Even if you're working, interning, or traveling, be sure to prioritize rest and recharging. This is the best way to be able to tune into your wants and desires for your future.

9. Learn a trade
College isn't the only place to further your education. Trade and vocational schools offer a unique opportunity to learn a valuable trade — for a fraction of the price and in significantly less time. At the end of your program, you'll earn a certificate of completion and be ready to start a career in your chosen field.

Learning a trade can be a substitute for college or it can be a way to get a better-paying job while attending college after trade school. According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average salary of trade jobs in 2022 was $65,850 (as opposed to the $85,800 for entry-level employees with a bachelor's degree in 2023). While it's true that prospective employees with a college degree still tend to make more than those without one, NPR reports that the “financial return from a bachelor's degree is softening.” Last year, the news organization cited a statistic from the Georgetown Center on Education and the Workforce which stated there were 30 million jobs nationally that didn't require a bachelor's degree and paid an average of $55,000.

There are dozens of fields of study in occupations including graphic design, bridal consulting, cosmetology, surgical technology, personal training, massage therapy, dental hygiene, video game design, and so many more.
