Whether it's for a semester or a summer, skipping town to study abroad is a means of immersing yourself in a new culture, learning a foreign language, and meeting lifelong friends. Once you've decided to take on the adventure, however, you'll probably be left a big question: What are the best places to study abroad? With so many beautiful and historically vibrant cities to explore throughout the world, how do you narrow it down?

We've rounded up our ten favorite study-abroad cities — read on to discover more about each city, complete with inside intel from college students who studied there!

Florence, Italy LAURA LEZZA
Dreaming of cappuccinos, carbonara, and cannoli? The menus alone will make you want to study abroad in Florence (and never come back!). Art and architecture lovers will be in Heaven, surrounded by important historical buildings filled with some of the world's greatest works of art. Don't miss the Duomo Cathedral, the Palazzo del Bargello, Pitti Palace, the Ufizzi Gallery, or Accademia Gallery (home Michael Angelo's David).

"Rich in art, culture, and fashion, Florence quickly transformed from a small foreign city into my home. From attending church in the exquisite Duomo to watching the sun set at Piazza Michelangelo, Italy truly captured my heart. And don't get me started on the food! I highly recommend taking an authentic cooking class or two. I also loved the slower pace of life—I really learned to appreciate it so much! And while, yes, classes are required, I didn't have to take any boring lectures. In my intro to journalism class, I had the opportunity to go out and interview one of Italy's finest leather makers and my segment aired on TV!" —Aubrey S., 23

2. Madrid, Spain
In Madrid, you'll see historic architecture, and you'll be able to take in fine art at Museo Reina Sofia and Museo del Prado. You'll never get tired of wandering the city streets, stopping for tapas along the way. Head to El Rastro on a Sunday — it's one of Europe's largest outdoor markets. At some point, treat yourself to a flamenco show — you are in the country where the famous Spanish dance originated, after all.

"Madrid is a cosmopolitan city known not for its sights, but for its energy. It's not that the landmarks aren't cool—I especially loved the Plaza Mayor, the grand Prado Museum, and the Royal Palace—but the Spanish way is what makes the biggest impact on you. You'll adjust to the fact that stores and restaurants close for a two-hour period in the middle of the day, and you won't wait until the end of the week to do any shopping since most places are closed on Sundays. Most importantly though, life in Madrid is lived out in the open. You'll see Spaniards energetically walking and talking, sipping cafes for hours, and eating dinner until what we would consider far past our bedtimes. The community of people celebrating no matter the occasion is truly the best thing about the city." —Martin L., 23

3. Paris, France

Paris, France FRÉDÉRIC SOLTAN
The romance, the beauty, the history — studying abroad in Paris will be the experience of a lifetime. You'll spend weekends biking along the Seine rive that flows through the middle of the city, or eating authentic French cheese with a baguette in one of the city's many gardens. You'll be able to some of the most famous museums and churches firsthand. Don't miss the Louvre, the Palace of Versailles, Notre-Dame, or the infamous Catacombs of Paris.

"I studied French for eight years before spending a fall in Paris. My favorite class was my daily language lesson, which was held in the most charming little classroom. The professor was a Parisian woman who had more impact on my grammar, vocabulary, and accent than any of the teachers who attempted to force French on me for nearly a decade. Rather than traveling on weekends, I chose to spend every free second of my time soaking up the city. As a result, I racked up a number of favorite spots to visit—neighborhood museums, local cafes, late-night haunts. By the time I left—in tears, of course—I could navigate Paris's winding streets blindfolded!" —Dena S., 22

4. Sydney, Australia
Sydney has come a long way since its days as a British penal colony. Today, it's home to some of the world's greatest beaches, exotic animals and cultural instutions like the Sydney Opera House. Spend an afternoon at the Royal Botanic Garden or take a boat tour of Darling Harbor. See kangaroos and koalas up close at the Wild Life Sydney Zoo. And as added bonus, native English speakers will be able to speak in their mother tongue.

"I studied at the University of Sydney, which is located right in the middle of the city and is only 15 minutes from the beach. I would take a surf lesson at Bondi in the morning, attend classes in the afternoon, and have a fun night out on the town all in one day. Whether you're in the mood for kayaking or skydiving, open-air cinemas or shopping at the local markets, this place has it all. There are the best organic cafes and free freshwater swimming pools located on every beach.The public transportation is really easy to use, but the best way to see the city is by water! Grab your friends and take a day trip to Manly by ferry; you'll be able to snap a photo of the Opera House and Harbour Bridge all in one take. And when you'd rather check them out on land, be sure to book tickets to see an outdoor concert on the steps of the awesome venue." —Olivia O., 23

5. Buenos Aires, Argentina
Can't decide between studying abroad in Europe or Latin America? Get the best of both worlds in Buenos Aires. Commonly referred to as the Paris of South America, Buenos Aires has a European flavor all its own. Dance tango with the locals until the break of dawn or ride horses in the sprawling Pampas. Spend an afternoon visiting museums to learn about the capital's storied political history or shop for antiques in the colorful neighborhoods of San Telma or La Boca.

"I studied Spanish for eight years and decided South America would be a great place to go, not to mention the fact that people call Buenos Aires the 'Paris' of the continent. The schools are unlike anything a typical American student would expect, but there's no better way to learn than oral exams in another language! BA definitely lives up to its reputation with regard to its beauty, architecture, cafe culture, and high fashion. I also loved exploring the city's street fairs and seeing outdoor tango performances. I was even able to travel to 11 of the 13 provinces and basically see the entire country! One of my favorites was Patagonia, which is located at the southern tip and is full of glaciers, penguins, and sea lions. It was also cool to see the Andes Mountains and Mendoza, the beautiful wine country." —Marisa S., 20

6. Prague, Czech Republic
Prague will provide you with a quintessential European experience. You'll traverse cobblestone streets, gobble up authentic goulash, and visit Prague Castle (established in the 9th century!). You'll love the thriving nightlife filled with eclectic clubs and open-at-all-hours restaurants, and will stand in awe at the John Lennon Wall. If you're there in the summer, don't miss the Prague Fringe Festival — it's a massive celebration showcasing international artists, actors, dancers, comedians and other creatives.

"The main reason I chose to study abroad in Prague was because I knew nothing about it before I went. I can now confidently say that it's one of the most underrated cities in Europe; it's small, and by the end of your time there, you'll get to know it extremely well. But despite its size, there's so much to do! You can visit the Prague Castle and the Communist Museum, and take a boat tour down the Charles River. Another great thing about Prague is how easy it is to travel around the rest of the continent; I was able to go to Amsterdam, Paris, Rome, Florence, Berlin, Munich, London, and Budapest all in one semester." —Sydney S., 22

7. London, England
If you're a native English speaker, this is one city where you won't experience in any language barrier. During your time in London, you'll see the River Thames, Westminster Abbey, Big Ben, Buckingham Palace, The British Museum, the London Eye, the Tower of London and so much more. London is also home to more than 5,000 museums and gallery. And if you're an English or theater major, you'll be happy to it's a short trek to Stratford-upon-Avon, where William Shakespeare was born.

"My six months in London were the most challenging and life-changing ones to date. It's an amazing city! The museums are all free and totally incredible. The theater scene is great, as is the shopping. There are also tons of exchange students, so if you're at a large school like University College London, you can reach out to the kids from other countries. I met a lot of Parisian students who, just like me, were spending the semester in England. Just don't be mad when Londoners impersonate you as a Valley Girl! It's not that you're obnoxious, it's just the equivalent of your awful British accent." —Beth P., 21

8. Cape Town, South Africa
On the southwest coast of Africa, you'll find exciting Capetown. Capetown is a geographically diverse region, surrounded by both mountains and beaches. Check out Boulders Beach, where African penguins actually make their home! Or spend a weekend afternoon hiking Table Mountain . No stay in Capetown would be complete without a visit to the Cape of Good Hope, known for its breathtaking views. One thing that might surprise you: students often go barefoot to class!

"My semester in Cape Town was my first time in Africa. My program toured around, and we saw everything from the beautiful beaches to the townships where we helped build a house. South Africa has a lot of history and culture that can be seen just by exploring all the different neighborhoods, but there are also really great museums and other historic sites. For me, the highlights were playing soccer with local kids in the townships, petting a baby lion, and being in an underwater cage surrounded by great white sharks. Really, animals are everywhere! When you're walking down the street, you'll see hippo and wild boar crossing signs and warnings about monkeys that will break into your room and steal your hats and jewelry if you don't lock the doors." —Alyssa B., 25

9. Hong Kong, China

Hong Kong is a bustling city, brimming with more than 7.9 million people. In the middle of the city, skyscrapers, modern architecture, and one of the world's most well-designed subways systems. Though it's a contemporary city, you'll still find plenty of historic and cultural sites, including famous gardens, Buddhist temples and monasteries. Be sure to check out Victoria Harbour, which offers boat tours, laser shows, and breathtaking views.

"Living in a city of Hong Kong's magnitude really does something to you. The most overwhelming part is the population density, closely followed by the brightest, most impressive skyline in the world. The overall infrastructure is incredible. From high-speed trains to over-water trams to insane skyscrapers, you really feel like you're in an episode of the Jetsons, but cooler. My program allowed me to visit the stock exchange, the port of Hong Kong (the busiest import and export facility in the world), and a number of large corporations and financial institutions. We split our time between learning in the classroom and participating in site visits, board meetings, and panel discussions with real-life business leaders. It was amazing! Also, you haven't Dim Summed until you've done it in HK." —Courtney G., 23

10. Beijing, China
Want to study abroad in China's capital? You'll get to dine on noodles, Peking Duck and dumplings, and visit significant sites like the Imperial Palace and the Temple of Heaven — not to mention the fact your a hour and half drive from the Great Wall of China.

"I chose to study in Beijing because it's about as different from the States as you can get when it comes to study abroad destinations. Being there ripped me from my comfort zone and opened my eyes to a totally foreign culture. Did you know there are more than 21 million people in Beijing? You definitely have to be OK with being in a crowd every moment of every day. The city is very easy to get around thanks to great public transportation, and there are hundreds of street markets and alleyways filled with exotic foods. I even ate a deep fried scorpion!" —Alexia C., 23
