Boarding school rules on phones and bedtimes help teens get more sleep
At one high school, students who boarded had a consistent lights-out time and no phone access in bed, with these students getting almost 5 hours of extra sleep a week compared with the students who only attended school during the day
Adolescents could get almost 5 extra hours of sleep per week if they have a consistent lights-out time and no phone access in bed, according to a study that analysed boarding school students who followed these rules.

“It’s a naturalistic experiment showing that the secret to good sleep in teenagers is quite simple: a regular routine and no mobile devices at night,” says Kurt Lushington at the University of South Australia.
Lushington and his colleague Alex Reardon studied the sleep patterns of 59 boarding students and 250 day students at a high school in Adelaide. The students were 15 to 18 years old and a mix of boys and girls.

The boarders had to leave their phones in a kitchen area or on their desk before they went to bed and turn out their lights by a set time, which varied according to their age.
The boarders slept for 40 minutes longer per night than the day students, averaging 8 hours and 26 minutes, compared with 7 hours and 46 minutes.

“I think this shows that if you put these norms in place, kids will go along with them,” says Lushington, who presented the results at the Australasian Sleep Association meeting in Brisbane in November.

Asaduzzaman Khan at the University of Queensland in Australia doesn’t recommend that parents take a teen’s phone away, but rather have a discussion to reach an agreement on a phone curfew.

This is more likely to work if parents do likewise and offer other entertainment, like books, says Khan. “It can be a real challenge and there’s no one-size-fits-all approach, but I think it’s worth trying for the benefits to mental and physical health, attention, learning ability and academic performance that come with extra sleep.”
