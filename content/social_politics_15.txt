It is a fact that our world is becoming increasingly digital every single day. The rapid speed of technological innovation can be overwhelming. But one young man is determined to change things. Jordan Mittler, the founder of Mittler Senior Technology, is on a mission to empower seniors by teaching them basic technology skills, allowing them to stay in touch with their loved ones and the world around them.

Meet Jordan Mittler
Jordan Mittler is not your ordinary technical specialist. He's a young, passionate individual who recognized the difficulties the elderly encounter with modern technology early on. Growing up in an age of devices and the internet, he realized how digital proficiency could improve communication and access to information.

However, he noticed his grandparents and other elderly individuals struggling to keep up. This motivated him to make a positive impact.

A Personalized Learning Approach
Mittler Senior Technology's strategy is straightforward yet extremely effective: patience, adaptation, and interaction. Jordan and his team of high school and college volunteers provide training on everything from fundamental computer and smartphone use to browsing social media, sending emails, and online shopping. The courses are designed to be step-by-step and hands-on, so seniors not only learn but also feel confident in their new abilities.

Breaking Down Isolation
One of the most significant impacts of Mittler Senior Technology is its ability to reduce isolation among seniors. Learning to use video calling services such as Zoom or Skype enables individuals to communicate with family and friends regardless of distance. Social media skills help them connect with communities, share their experiences, and join support groups.

Email and messaging services provide new avenues for contact, helping people maintain ties and stay informed. For many seniors, the ability to engage with technology means the difference between isolation and connection.

Before joining the classes, many participants felt left behind in a rapidly digitalizing world. Through Mittler Senior Technology, they rediscover the joy of connecting with loved ones, participating in community activities, and accessing vital information.

Creating a Community
Beyond technical expertise, Jordan's workshops foster a sense of community. They are more than just instructional seminars; they are social gatherings where seniors can socialize, discuss their accomplishments, and form new bonds. This sense of community is critical for addressing the emotional and psychological aspects of isolation, offering an extended support network outside the classroom.

These gatherings become a platform for sharing stories, celebrating milestones, and building friendships. The seniors find a safe space where they can express their fears and triumphs related to technology, knowing they are not alone in their journey. The camaraderie developed in these sessions often extends beyond the classroom, fostering long-term relationships and a supportive community network.

Impact and Collaboration
To date, Mittler Senior Technology has empowered over 3,500 seniors across 10 different countries, inspired more than 150 teens to volunteer, and conducted over 450 classes. Additionally, they have partnered with Web-Ready, a sustainable website development nonprofit, to enhance their website's efficiency and reduce its carbon footprint. Through this collaboration, they have successfully planted over 125 trees, demonstrating their commitment to both technological and environmental sustainability.

The partnership with Web-Ready not only improves the functionality and accessibility of their online platform but also underscores their dedication to sustainable practices. By reducing their digital carbon footprint, Mittler Senior Technology sets an example of responsible technology use, aligning their mission with broader environmental goals.

Adapting to Challenges
The COVID-19 pandemic underscored the necessity of digital literacy among the elderly. Mittler Senior Technology quickly adapted by shifting classes online, ensuring that their mission continued uninterrupted. This transition also served as a practical demonstration of the skills being taught, proving that it's never too late to learn and adapt. Seniors learned to navigate virtual classrooms, gaining the confidence to participate in the digital world.

The pandemic posed significant challenges, but it also highlighted the resilience and adaptability of both the instructors and the seniors. Moving classes online required rapid adjustments and new teaching methods, but it also expanded the program's reach, allowing seniors from various geographical locations to join and benefit from the classes.

A Model for the Future
Jordan Mittler's work is a shining example of how technology can be harnessed for good. His empathetic and practical approach meets seniors where they are, making learning accessible and enjoyable. His organization does more than just teach technology; it enriches lives by fostering connections and reducing isolation.

The success of Mittler Senior Technology serves as a model for other initiatives aiming to bridge the digital divide. By focusing on personalized learning, community building, and sustainable practices, Jordan's approach offers valuable lessons for anyone looking to make a positive impact through technology.

Success Stories and Testimonials
Many seniors have shared their success stories and testimonials, highlighting the profound impact of Mittler Senior Technology. One participant, Shelly, expressed, "Before joining Jordan's classes, I was never able to send pictures on my phone, but now I can. I feel much more comfortable with the icons.

I've had many teachers, and Jordan is a natural. I'm much less afraid of the computer now." These personal stories showcase the tangible benefits of the program and inspire others to join.

As Mittler Senior Technology continues to evolve, Jordan remains committed to broadening its reach. Future plans include developing more advanced courses, creating materials tailored to individual needs, and partnering with senior centers to extend their impact. His unwavering passion and dedication demonstrate the profound impact of using technology responsibly to bridge generational gaps.

Jordan envisions a future where no senior feels left behind due to technological barriers. By continuously expanding the scope of their offerings and fostering collaborations with other organizations, Mittler Senior Technology aims to create a more inclusive and connected world for seniors.
